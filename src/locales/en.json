Legal terminology</strong></p><p>Accurate translation of legal documents requires not only knowledge of the language, but also an understanding of legal terminology and context. Lawyers understand the concepts embedded in one or another term, and the translator without that understanding can do a technically correct translation, leading to misunderstanding or 'expensive' legal mistakes, with significant consequences for cooperation and obligations. For example, 'indemnify' and 'compensate' in common usage may seem equivalent, but in the legal context they carry completely different obligations.<strong><br /></strong></p><p><strong>2. Understanding the peculiarities of different jurisdictions</strong></p><p>Legal systems and terminology vary greatly between countries, without understanding which it is impossible to accurately translate documents. For example, in the EU 'competition law' means the same as in the US 'antitrust law', the term 'probate' is used both in the US and in the UK, but is absent in the EU.</p><p><strong>3. Analytical and strategic thinking. Ability to adapt, identify and avoid legal risks, and negotiate, not just translate.<br /></strong></p><p>A translator may only directly translate the text or what was said, but is not able to analyze the content, to identify and avoid possible risks during the conversation, to find the 'pitfalls' or brainstorm questions that should be asked to the other party or answers that should be avoided. Our goal is a strategic approach to negotiations or disputes, helping us to achieve the Client's goals, not just a translation of words.</p><p><strong>4. Knowledge of formatting and standards of legal documents<br /></strong></p><p>Different legal systems have specific requirements for the formatting, wording and structure of official documents. Compliance with these standards is important when working with partners, when submitting to courts or government agencies.</p><p><strong>5. Compliance with confidentiality and ethical standards<br /></strong></p><p>Advocates are obliged to preserve confidentiality and ethical principles that protect the information entrusted by the Client.</p><p><strong>6. Speed, professionalism and certification<br /></strong></p><p>Advocates who have obtained degrees in law from reputable foreign universities, use English in communications as native speakers, and translation of complex legal documents is an easy task for us. An ordinary translator is involved in all areas and industries, so the translation of even a small legal text takes a considerable amount of time with no guarantee of accuracy.<strong><br /></strong></p>"
