		<p>1.1. These Terms of Use constitute a legally binding agreement made between you, whether personally or on
			behalf of an entity (“you”) and <b>Advocates’ Association “YOUR HONOR”, (“we”, “us”, or “our”)</b>,
			concerning your
			access to and use of the <a href="https://advocate-online.com/">https://advocate-online.com/</a> website
			(“Website”) as well as any other sites, social
			media platforms, media channels, mobile website or mobile application related, linked, or otherwise
			connected thereto. You agree that by accessing the Website, you have read, understood, and agree to be bound
			by all of these Terms of Use. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE WITH ALL OF THESE TERMS OF USE, THEN YOU ARE EXPRESSLY
			PROHIBITED FROM USING THE WEBSITE AND YOU MUST DISCONTINUE ITS USE IMMEDIATELY.</p>

		<p>1.2. Supplemental terms and conditions or documents that may be posted on the Website from time to time are
			hereby expressly incorporated herein by reference. We reserve the right, in our sole discretion, to make
			changes or modifications to these Terms of Use at any time and for any reason. We will alert you about any
			changes by updating the “Last updated” date of these Terms of Use, and you waive any right to receive

			stay informed of updates. You will be subject to, and will be deemed to have been made aware of and to have
			accepted, the changes in any revised Terms of Use by your continued use of the Website after the date such
			revised Terms of Use are posted.</p>

		<p>1.3. The information provided on the Website is not intended for distribution to or use by any person or
			entity in any jurisdiction or country where such distribution or use would be contrary to law or regulation
			or which would subject us to any registration requirement within such jurisdiction or country. Accordingly,
			those persons who choose to access the Website from other locations do so on their own initiative and are
			solely responsible for compliance with local laws, if and to the extent local laws are applicable.</p>

		<h2>2. Intellectual Property Rights</h2>
		<p>2.1. Unless otherwise indicated, the Website is our proprietary property and all articles, source code,
			databases,
			functionality, software, website designs, audio, video, text, photographs, and graphics on the Website
			(collectively, <b>the “Content”</b>) and the trademarks, service marks, and logos contained therein (<b>the

	<section id="part3">
		<h2>3. Payment and Fees</h2>
		<p>3.1. We accept the following forms of payment:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>(1) Visa</li>
			<li>(2) Mastercard</li>
		</ul>
		<p>3.2. You may be required to pay a fee during the payment transaction, depending on your bank. You agree to
			provide current, complete, and accurate payment transaction information for all payments made via the
			Website. You further agree to promptly update account and payment information, including email address,
			payment method, and payment card expiration date, so that we can complete your transactions and contact you
			as needed.</p>
		<p>3.3. Your payment transactions will be processed via <a href="https://www.easypay.ua/">EasyPay</a>. The price
			for the services is not fixed, as it depends on the specific
			services we shall provide to every particular client, on the complexity of the issue, time of our advocates
			that shall be spent to resolve the issue, and the urgency. We provide service fees as accurately as possible
			in advance, so that you can understand and plan all the expected costs.</p>
		<p>3.4. The first step is to call us at +380962580135 or write an email at <a
				href="mailto:103advocat@gmail.com">103advocat@gmail.com</a> and describe the issue you want to resolve.
			In certain cases, it may be needed to do a prior analysis of the documents in order to assess the price of
			services as accurately as possible. We shall provide a free consultation on our services which may help you
			to resolve your issue, their pricing, timelines, provide any information on how the price is determined, and
			what additional expenditures may arise.</p>
		<p>3.5. As the second step, in case you agree to receive our services for the agreed price – you should pay a
			deposit of 50% of the service cost by using one of the preferred methods:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>(1) By paying at our Website, the payment transaction will be processed via <a
					href="https://www.easypay.ua/">EasyPay</a>. You shall fill in the required fields
				with accurate and complete information.</li>
			<li>(2) By paying via bank at your choice under the received invoice.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>3.6. The invoice is valid for 1 (one) month. When more than 1 (one) month has passed from the moment of our
			prior assessment, the price for the services may be changed. In such case, please contact us to get to know
			the up-to-date price for the services. All payments shall be in Ukrainian hryvnia (UAH).</p>
		<p>3.7. You agree to pay all charges or fees for your payment transactions. We reserve the right to correct any
			errors or mistakes in pricing, even if we have already sent an invoice or received payment.</p>
		<p>3.8. We also reserve the right to refuse any order placed through the Website at our own discretion. In such
			a case, the transaction will be deemed void, and the prepaid sum will be returned to the account from which
			the funds were paid.</p>
	</section>

	<section id="part4">
		<h2>4. Cancellation of Services</h2>
		<p>4.1. All payment transactions are non-refundable, unless refused to be submitted by us.
			The reason for this is that your payment is your confirmation of accepting the terms and conditions of
			our <a href="https://advocate-online.com/legal-aid-agreement">Legal Services Agreement (public offer)</a>,
			and it shall be the legal basis for us to start rendering the
			services.
			Once we started to provide our legal services to you, the paid deposit of 50% of the service cost cannot
			be refunded.</p>
	</section>

	<section id="part5">
		<h2>5. Return of Funds</h2>
		<p>5.1. The nature of legal services is inherently intangible and final. Once a legal service, such as advice,
			document drafting, negotiation, or representation, is rendered, it cannot be "undone" or physically
			returned. These services involve intellectual effort, expertise, and time invested in addressing the
			client's specific needs.</p>
		<p>5.2. Similar to a haircut, where the process cannot be reversed once performed, the legal services provided
			result in a final output that cannot be physically reverted or replaced.</p>
		<p>5.3. Outcome or results of provided services are not guaranteed. When you use our services, it is for our
			level of expertise, dedication, and time devoted to your specific matter, rather than a specific outcome or
			result. We will make every legal effort to achieve your desired outcome, but cannot guarantee any results
			due to the uniqueness of each case. You understand that we will perform services and use all reasonable
			means to help you with resolving your issue, but that no specific outcome has been guaranteed.</p>
		<p>5.4. Please, contact us at <a href="mailto:103advocat@gmail.com">103advocat@gmail.com</a> or call
			+380962580135 if you are unsatisfied for any reason with our services, by verifying your identity,
			describing the core of the issue, the date of payments made, what are your considerations regarding the
			services, and the advocate who was providing you with the services. We shall reply to your complaint as soon
			as possible and take immediate actions.</p>

		<h2>18. Governing Law and Dispute Resolution</h2>

		<p>18.1. These conditions are governed by and interpreted following the laws of Ukraine, and the use of the
			United Nations Convention of Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded. If your
			habitual residence is in the EU, and you are a consumer, you additionally possess the protection provided to
			you by obligatory provisions of the law of your country of residence. Advocates’ Association “YOUR HONOR”
			and yourself both agree to submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of Ukraine, which means that
			you may make a claim to defend your consumer protection rights in regards to these Terms of Use in Ukraine.
		</p>

		<p>18.2. To expedite resolution and control the cost of any dispute, controversy, or claim related to these
			Terms of Use (each a “Dispute” and collectively, the “Disputes”) brought by either you or us (individually,
			a “Party” and collectively, the “Parties”), the Parties agree to first attempt to negotiate any Dispute
			(except those Disputes expressly provided below) informally for at least thirty (30) days before initiating
			arbitration. Such informal negotiations commence upon written notice from one Party to the other Party.</p>

		<p>18.3. Any dispute arising from the relationships between the Parties to these Terms of Use shall be resolved
			by the courts of Ukraine. The language of the proceedings shall be Ukrainian. Applicable rules of
			substantive law shall be the law of Ukraine.</p>

		<p>18.4. The Parties agree that any arbitration shall be limited to the Dispute between the Parties
			individually. To the full extent permitted by law:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>(1) no arbitration shall be joined with any other proceeding;</li>
			<li>(2) there is no right or authority for any Dispute to be arbitrated on a class-action basis or to utilize
				class action procedures; and</li>
			<li>(3) there is no right or authority for any Dispute to be brought in a purported representative capacity on
				behalf of the general public or any other persons.</li>
